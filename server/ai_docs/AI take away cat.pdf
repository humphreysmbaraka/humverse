(b).DOMAINS
            These are all possible values that can be assigned to the variables involved in the problem.they include:

             Possible time slots, days, and available classrooms for each class.
             Available time slots, days, and examination halls for each exam.
             Appropriate time slots and venues for each event.

         examples:
            for subjects,the allowed subjects inputs are(math english science religion)
            fof class venues,the allowed input venues are(LT201,LT101,LT404,LT201)
            for duration,the allowed durations for classes exams and events inputs are from 0 to 2 hours
            for exam and events venues,the allowed venues inputs are(dinning hall,hall 11,hall 12,hall 13,hall 15,hall 16)
            allowed inputs for days are (monday tuesdat wednesday thursday friday)

            those are the only values that can be assigned to the parameters(variables)

(c).CONSTRAINTS
               
             The constraints which will define and regulate the relationship between the variables(subject,duration, events and venues
             will set the following limits to the problem:


            no class exam and event should be given the same time slot and venue in the same day.
            no class, exam or event should last more than two hours
            a maximum 60% of venues should be used in a single day to avoid exhaustion of resources. 

(D)OBJECTIVE FUNCTIONS
            gaps between classes and events must be minimal
            assigned venues for classes,exams and venues must be able to hold the number of students.
            exams should not be very close in shedule













QUESTION 2:

(1).STATE SPACE
       this is a set of all possible configurations that can be achieved from a certain state.
       In this context, the state space referes to all possible configurations the robot can have with respect to the maze

(2).INITIAL STATE AND GOAL STATE
       The initial state of the robot is its first position or configuration in the maze before taking any actions while the
       goal state is the robot's desired final destination which in this context is the exit of the maze.

(3).ACTIONS
       in this context, the actions the rodot can take in the maze are in form of directional movements.These movements will
       change the robot's position in the maze and the positions can be expressed in the cartessian plane form(x,y).The actions
       iclude:
                 a.moving forward
                 b.moving downwards
                 c.moving left
                 d.moving right

(4)TRANSITION MODEL
         A transition model defines the states attainable by actions done by an agent.In this context,the state is the position
         of the robot in the maze and the actions are its movements in the maze which are movements forward,backward,left and right.
         These movements affect the robots position or state in the maze as follows:

             .MOVING FORWARD will cause an increment in the y coordinate of the robot's position such that if it moves n units forward,
              its new position if its initial position was(x,y), will be (x,y+n).

             .MOVING BACKWARD will cause a decrement in the y coordinate of the robot's position such that if it moves n units backwards,
              its new position if its initial position was(x,y), will be (x,y-n).

             .MOVING RIGHT will cause an increment in the x coordinate of the robot's position such that if it moves R units right,
              its new position if its initial position was(x,y), will be (x+R,y).

             .MOVING LEFT will cause a decrement in the x coordinate of the robot's position such that if it moves R units left,
              its new position if its initial position was(x,y), will be (x-R,y).


(5).COST FUNCTION
        Every action will have its cost or all can also have a uniform cost.Since some actions will be more strategic than other actions,
        they will have a greater cost compared to less strategic actions.As well defined costfunction N can be used to determine the cost
        of an action a.i.e N(a).


(6).SEARCH ALGORITHM
         Since the initial state,the goal state and the maze's structure are all known, this maze can be best solved using AN INFORMED SEARCH ALGORITHM.
         In my opinion, an A* search algorithm will work best because since different sequences of actions can be taken to reach the goal state,not all
         will be optimal.Therefore before any action is taken,the distance of the robot from the goal state(exit)should be estimated or calculated using 
         a well defined heusteric function and also the sum of costs accrued to reach the robot's current state calculated.The sum of these two values 
         should be compared for different optionsof different sequences of actions and the option with the lowest sum will be taken.This increases the 
         chances of coming up with an optimal solution
         and that is why i would use the A* search algorithm to solve this maze problem.
